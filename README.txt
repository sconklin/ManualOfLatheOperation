This is the "Manal of Lathe Operation and Machinists Tables"

I have scanned and cleaned up a 1937 copy of this manual.

The manual came with a supplement detailing changes corresponding to the Sears Craftsman model of this lathe, which I have.

I prepared a version of the manual specific to the Sears Craftsman model, substituting the appropriate tables and diagrams.
