This is the "Manal of Lathe Operation and Machinists Tables"

I have scanned and cleaned up a 1937 copy of this manual.

This repo contains the source images for each page and the script to generate the complete pdf files (un Linux).

The complete pdf documents are hosted here:

The manual came with a supplement detailing changes corresponding to the Sears Craftsman model of this lathe, which I have.

I prepared a version of the manual specific to the Sears Craftsman model, substituting the appropriate tables and diagrams.
